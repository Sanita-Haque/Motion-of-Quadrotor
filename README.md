# Motion-of-Quadrotor

Prepared the state space representation of the planar motion of a quadrotor, linearized the nonlinear system, and
concluded whether the system is controllable or observable.
Designed a state space and observer feedback controller and analyzed the system state response using Matlab differential
equation solver ODE45
